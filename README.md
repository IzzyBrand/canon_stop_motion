# canon_stop_motion
Computer interface for making stop motion videos with a DSLR using python-gphoto2

This has been tested on OSX with a Canon SL2.

## Install

Install libgphoto2 with Homebrew
```
brew install libgphoto2
```

Install the python requirements. I recommend you use a virtualenv
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
